# raspberry-pi-led

This repo contains some scripts I created for controlling LEDs with my Raspberry Pi.
It's just some basic stuff like turning an LED on for 1 second then turning it off again. It will get more complicated as I go along.

Explaination of the scripts in this repo:

## single_led.py

It turns on an LED for 1 second then turns it off again.

## three_leds.py

It turn on and off 3 LEDs in sequence.
